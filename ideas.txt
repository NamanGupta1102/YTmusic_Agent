# Future Tool Ideas for YT Music Agent

1. The "Taste Matcher" (Recommendations Tool)
   - Concept: get_recommendations(video_id)
   - Why: Instead of guessing songs, search for one seed song, then ask YouTube: "What plays next?" (Radio feature).
   - Tech: likely using get_watch_playlist() from ytmusicapi.

2. The "Library Manager" (Add to Existing)
   - Concept: add_to_playlist(playlist_name, song_list)
   - Why: Add songs to existing playlists (e.g., "Gym", "Chill") instead of always creating new ones.
   - Tech: Needs fuzzy matching to find playlist ID by name, then add_playlist_items().

3. The "Crate Digger" (Mood/Genre Browse)
   - Concept: get_mood_playlists(mood="Chill")
   - Why: Find other existing playlists based on mood or genre.
   - Tech: Explore/Moods tab data extraction.
